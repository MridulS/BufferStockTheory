 *** WARNING - you have selected SAFER, indicating you want Ghostscript
               to execute in a safer environment, but at the same time
               have selected WRITESYSTEMDICT. Unless you use this option with
               care and specifically, remember to execute code like:
                      "systemdict readonly pop"
               it is possible that malicious code may be able to evade the
               limited security offered by the SAFER option.
